                        <h2>Bangladesh made history with win over England</h2>
                        <p>it was a long time coming. 16 years and 95 Tests. And finally, Bangladesh have a Test victory that can be truly celebrated. Yes, they have won seven matches before their 108-run victory over England in Dhaka this week. <br><br>But all of those came with something of a caveat. Five of the seven victories came against Zimbabwe, and not even Zimbabwe at their strongest; rather it was an underfunded, undervalued and disheartened Zimbabwe that dipped in and out of Test cricket, struggling to stay competitive.</p>

                        <p>Nobody gave Bangladesh a chance when they took to the field against New Zealand in the Group A encounter. But the Tigers believed in themselves. <br>

                        They lost the toss and the Kiwis decided to bat first on a flat track in Cardiff. New Zealand were coasting along at 201/3 but then they lost their key batsman Ross Taylor. The wicket triggered a collapse of sorts as New Zealand were restricted to just 265.
                        The bowling effort gave Bangladesh hope but those hopes were dashed soon as New Zealand bowlers pegged them back with four early wickets.</p>

                        <p>This was probably the biggest ODI upset that Bangladesh have pulled off till date, one that shook the cricketing world. India had been in the finals of the 2003 edition but four years later things were not the same anymore. <br><br>
                        India went into the game as the overwhelming favourites even though there were reports of internal conflicts between the team.
                        Rahul Dravid won the toss and decided to bat but then realized what a grave mistake he had made. Bangladesh bowlers ripped through the batting line-up bowling them out for just 191. The only notable contributions came from the bat of Sourav Ganguly (66) and Yuvraj Singh (4).</p>

                          But Bangladesh somehow managed to pull of the improbable by bowling out Pakistan for just 161.<br><br>
                          The latter chose to field after winning the toss and restricted Bangladesh to just 233 first. For such a famed batting line-up, 233 wasn’t even a challenging target but then Bangladesh speedster Khaled Mahmud had other ideas. </p>

                  <p>Bangladesh's first official foray into international cricket came in the 1979 ICC Trophy in England. On 31 March 1986, Bangladesh played its first ODI match, against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. For a long time, football was the most popular sport in Bangladesh, but cricket gradually became very popular – particularly in urban areas – and by the late 1990s had surpassed football.</p>
